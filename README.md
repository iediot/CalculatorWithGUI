This is a simple calculator app with a GUI made using QT and C++.

It may not work on various other systems, I don't know how the scaling goes if the window is resized.

Works well on my machine, but it probably looks horrendous on others, because of the kind of hard coded scaling values.

It holds features like not allowing badly written expressions, giving out an error if the expression is unfinished,
a good way of doing harder and longer ones.

Fun 8/10, Learning 5/10 since it's my first app with a GUI.
